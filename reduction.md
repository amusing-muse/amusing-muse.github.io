Reduced data can be downloaded from [here](http://www.sc.eso.org/~janderso/AMUSING/)

Note, there is also a tar file: AMUSING_sample_char.tar that unpacks into various directories, but importantly has a full characterisation of the galaxies thus far observed (up to the end of P96), available here: http://www.sc.eso.org/~janderso/AMUSING/AMUSING_sample_char.tar


### Reduction level 0:
Thomas Kruelher is doing somewhat automated reductions using the MUSE pipeline. The aim is that we have baseline reductions in ‘real-time’ (meaning most likely several weeks) post observations. Most probably improvements can be made on these reductions with a more manual approach, together with new pipeline releases etc, however this will ensure that we do not create a bottleneck of raw data.
Reductions to be done on the ESO Vitacura MUSE machine.
Data were re-reduced with some post-processing (w.r.t. sky-subtraction). Data now being reduced in Germany (still Thomas)
Note, as of P96 a new sky-subtraction algorithm was available… Now being used for reduction

### Data storage:
Only final data cubes to be stored?
How to store these? On a machine in ESO that is observable from outside? In the cloud?
Pancho says we could store the data on the CMM storage, which has access to the reuna Chilean network… CMM data/data products storage on large back-up server discusion on-going
Currently data stored in Germany. I will mirror this soon. Need to think about future storage etc.

### Repetition of OBs:
Some OBs have been observed (16/04/15) and classified as ‘C’ due to clouds. However, the data look great, and hence we could already have multiple epochs of MUSE observations within this semester.
This is the case in ~10 galaxies in P95. 2 in P96.
