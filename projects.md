Project AM3
PI: L. Wang
Title: “Exploring the SNe environments and related issues through their narrow absorption lines”
Abstract: “As SN sample sizes increase, SN host extinction dominates the systematic error when using them as distance indicators for cosmology. Here we will construct complete SN host extinction maps based on 3D (x, y, λ) IFU data cubes by means of mapping narrow ISM absorption lines (Na I, K I, Ca II H&K, DIB5780) and HII region emission lines (Balmer decrement). We will compare and test various empirical reddening relations between the spectral lines and color excess EB−V . From the multiple dust extinction indicators obtained with IFU cubes, the dust properties of the overall spatially resolved host together with that at the specific SN site will be constrained. Therefore, the degeneracy of SN color excess from its intrinsic color and dust extinction will likely be broken and finally the nature of SN intrinsic color will be constrained. The extinction map will shed light on the systematic errors of the distance measurements for Type Ia and Type II SNe. A direct comparison of sodium excess and blueshifted narrow absorption Na I doublets, both present in the galaxies and SN spectra, will allow us to understand the nature of galactic winds and pre-SN outflows. The CSM or ISM origin problem to the Na excess of Type Ia SNe will hopefully be solved by mapping the blueshifted Na I features of SN host galaxies and the SN positions on BPT diagram, hence possibly providing tight constraints to their progenitor systems. Meanwhile, the DIB5780, etc may be applied to explore the origin of the diffuse interstellar bands.”

Project AM4
PI: A. Razza
Title: “Extinction laws towards supernova host galaxies with integral field spectroscopy”
Abstract: “Along the last 30 years it has grown evidence of the presence of an oxygen abundance gradient in spiral galaxies that has been interpreted as an evidence of inside-out growth. More recently it has been proposed the presence of a common abundance gradient and central decrement correlated with the mass of galaxies, by the use of IFU surveys. However, its characterization is hampered by the coarse resolution of those surveys (CALIFA, PINGS, MaNGA...), thus we would like to explore it by the analysis of the HII regions within the AMUSING dataset.”
Data usage: All semesters, especially those data with Av/Rv calculations from the SNe(Ia)
Status (06/09/17): Alessandro recently arrived at ESO to start his thesis project which will be working on this project. Significant progress expected in the coming months.

Project AM5
PI: J. Lyman
Title: “Search for long-lived SN Halpha emission”
Abstract: “The SV data for MUSE had observations of SN 2005ip almost 10 years after the SN exploded. The SN is the brightest object in the galaxy in Halpha (excluding the galaxy centre). It displays strong, broad emission  and other SNe have also been seen to show Halpha emission on a timescale of years. We propose a search of all galaxies in AMUSING to look for evidence of long-lived broad Halpha emission at any location in order to search for missed SNe displaying this behaviour (this can be broadened to all public MUSE data of nearby galaxies or parts of galaxies). We will fit emission lines to the continuum-subtracted data to find regions that are not well fit by narrower lines (~100 km/s) typical of HII regions to search for candidate broad emission regions. Any detections will be subject to proposals to follow up their evolution. We will place rates (or rate limits for no detections) on these types of events. Also involved: L. Galbany, H. Kuncarayakti, C. Badenes, P. James ...”

Project AM6
PI: F. F. Rosales-Ortega
Title: “On the diffuse gas in spiral galaxies using MUSE IFS data”
Abstract: “The goal is to try to quantify the fraction of diffuse gas with respect to the total Halpha emission in a given galaxy. Previous attempts to do so were based either on narrow band imaging (which lack the full spectroscopic information) or using spectroscopic methods in small field-of-views and/or with low spatial resolution. Given the superb characteristics of the AMUSING observations in terms of coverage, spatial and spectral resolution, we can attempt to sample a good range of the HII region luminosity function, and potentially, to try to quantify the escape fraction of ionizing radiation in sample of local star forming galaxies. This have important connotations for higher redshift objects, as we could quantify how much of the Halpha emission in a galaxy is actually related to star formation, and which fraction should not be considered for determinations of SFR when the galaxies cannot be spatially resolved.”

Status (11/09/17): now has a PhD student who may work on this, trying to have a draft by mid-2018.

Project AM7
PI: Javier Casado
Title: “BaTMAn: A coherent segmentation map code”
Abstract: “BaTMAn: Bayesian Technique for Multi-image Analysis is a binning algorithm specially devoted to simultaneously tessellate several layers of an IFS datacube (several line maps, velocity maps, wavelengths, etc). The purpose of applying the algorithm to MUSE data is to test its robustness and power. Its spatial properties, a 300x300 spaxels grid in a 1' FoV, make MUSE the perfect test bench for BatMAn, as it is probably the dataset that can benefit the most from it. We will compare the performance of the binning tool with other methods typically used in IFS analysis, such as Voronoi binning techniques or the imposition of signal-to-noise thresholds.”

PI: L. Sánchez-Menguiano
Title: “Oxygen abundance gradients + central decrement”
Abstract: “Along the last 30 years it has grown evidence of the presence of an oxygen abundance gradient in spiral galaxies that has been interpreted as an evidence of inside-out growth. More recently it has been proposed the presence of a common abundance gradient and central decrement correlated with the mass of galaxies, by the use of IFU surveys. However, its characterization is hampered by the coarse resolution of those surveys (CALIFA, PINGS, MaNGA...), thus we would like to explore it by the analysis of the HII regions within the AMUSING dataset.”

Project AM9
PI: L. Sánchez-Menguiano
Title: “The global and local MZ relation explored with MUSE”
Abstract: “We would like to explore the well known M-z relation proposed by Tremonti et al. (2004) using the extensive catalog of HII regions, extracted with unique resolution, in order to understand if part of the dispersion described in the literature is due to contamination due to diffuse gas, which is clearly addressed by the super-resolution of MUSE datasets. Evenmore, we propose to characterize the Sigma-z relation (or local M-z relation), proposed by Rosales-Ortega et al. 2012, and the possible secondary relation with the SFR.”

Title: “Sulphur electron temperatures”
Abstract: “Thanks to the MUSE wavelength coverage, [SIII] electron temperatures are available from [SIII] 6312A and [SIII] 9069A and [9532]A lines. We plan to produce high quality continuous electron temperature maps of [SIII] along ionic abundances of the AMUSING galaxies that meet the S/N requirements and investigate the possible spatial temperature variations. Since there is a known empirical relation between [SIII] and [OIII] temperatures, other programs investigating oxygen abundances can benefit from this project.”

Project AM12
PI: F. Pinna
Title: “Unveiling the sources of disk heating in spiral galaxies”
Abstract: “The stellar velocity ellipsoid (SVE) quantifies the amount of velocity dispersion in the vertical, radial and azimuthal directions. Since different disk heating mechanisms (e.g. spiral arms, giant molecular clouds, minor mergers, etc) affect these components differently, the SVE can constrain the sources of heating in disk galaxies. At present the 3D nature of the SVE can only be directly measured in the Milky Way but, thanks to integral-field surveys we are now in position to carry out the same kind of analysis in external galaxies. For this purpose, we will gather a sample of intermediate inclined spiral galaxies along the Hubble sequence (Sa to Sd types) with high quality stellar kinematic maps in the AMUSING survey. This will allow us to probe the SVE for each galaxy from different line-of-sights in different regions, and thus provide strong constraints on its shape. The ultimate goal is to relate our findings to realistic numerical simulations of disks with different formation histories (quiescent vs mergers), and we will also put the results of the Milky Way in context with the general population of spiral galaxies. INVOLVED:  F. Pinna, J. Falcon-Barroso, M. Martig, G. van de Ven, M. Lyubenova, R. Leaman + AMUSING team”

PI: C. Cobá
Title: “Emission line associated with a AGN driven jet in NGC232”
Abstract: “We describe the serendipity discovery of an optical jet driven by a central AGN in the galaxy NGC232, that extend across several kpc almost perpendicular to the galactic plany of the galaxy. The analysis of the gas kinematics and emission line ratios indicate that most probably the optical jet is ionized by a mixture of direct ionization by the AGN and shocks due to the lateral expansion of the jet across a dense medium. To our knowledge only two of these optical jets have been observed before (3C120 and 3C273), what place this object among one of the few laboratories to study this kind of processes.”

Title: “The lowest metallicity type II supernova from a high mass red-supergiant progenitor”
Abstract: “Red supergiant (RSG) stars have been confirmed as the progenitor stars of the majority of hydrogen-rich type II supernovae (SNe II). However, while RSGs are observed with masses >25 M⊙, detections of SN II progenitors with masses >18 M⊙ (To be defined) have remained elusive. RSGs are also expected to form and explode at all metallicities, but given the his-torical galaxy-targeted nature of past SN surveys, in addition to the low amount of total star-formation within low-luminosity galaxies (leading to a low SN rate), discoveries of explosions from such low-metallicity progenitors are also scarce. Here, we report observations of the SN II CSS140925:223344-062208, aka SN 2015bs, for which we infer a progenitor metallicity of Z0.1 Z⊙ and a Zero Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) mass of 17-18 M⊙. SN 2015bs displays a relatively normal light-curve morphology, together with the typical Balmer lines usually observed in photospheric-phase spectra of SNe II, implying a RSG progenitor. However, there is a clear lack of strong spectral lines originating from heavier elements such as iron. Comparison to spectral models confirm a progenitor metallicity of 0.1 Z⊙ or lower. This is consistent with observations of the host galaxy that constrain its absolute magnitude to be the lowest of any SN II host to-date, implying significantly sub-solar metallicity. At 2late phases SN 2015bs also shows unique features among SNe II. [OI] 6300,6364 °A is much stronger with respect to H  and [Ca II] 7291,7323 °A than for all other known SNe II. Nebular hydrogen emission is also broader implying higher velocities for the outer core material4. SN 2015bs is thus constrained to have a helium core mass produced by the explosion of an 17-18 M⊙ (To be defined) initial mass progenitor (Actually, putting a value here is necessary? Probably, but note Jesper’s ’strong logic’ point.). Why such a massive progenitor should also
be related to such a low progenitor metallicity is currently unknown.”

Title: “SweetSpot NIR SNIa LC/HR correlations with host galaxy properties”
Abstract: We will study SweetSpot SN Ia NIR Hubble residual correlations with both global and local host galaxy properties. In P98 we got 28 SwSp galaxies and some more are planned for P99.

Title: “SN Ia and CCSN delay time distribution (DTD) measurement ”
Abstract: Once the SFH of all spectra are determined, one can apply the Maoz & Badenes MC method to infer the DTD of different SN types. We expect to use 3-4 age bins and focus on the detection of signal in the 40-100 Myr bin for CCSNe (binary progenitors), and the 100-300 Myr for SNe Ia (turn-on).
Data usage: All semesters

Project AM19
PI: L. Galbany
Title: “young/old supernova remnants detection”
Abstract: Ejecta-dominated SNR show broad emissions from H and O in their spectra. ISM-dominated SNR present higher SII/Ha ratios than HII regions. The idea is to look for these two families in all AMUSING datacubes. I found a method to discover broad emission that successfully found all known SN in nebular phases in our data. Hopefully we will find some new detections, but if not, I would like to present the method and write a short paper on ‘Unexpected objects in IFS data’.

Project AM20
PI: J. Méndez-Abreu
Title: The Origins of Galaxy Bimodality: Quenching Mechanisms over the last 8 Gyrs”
Abstract: This project is about understanding these quenching processes that are responsible for changing galaxies from the disky/irregular balls of gas observed at high redshift, into the bimodal population of star-forming spirals and quiescent ellipticals seen around us today. Particular attention will be paid to understand the effect of environment (field vs. clusters) in galaxy quenching. The main objective is to understand galaxy evolution by revealing why some galaxies are still forming stars, while others are “red and dead”. To this aim, the student will use data from the state-of-the-art Integral Field Spectroscopic surveys (AMUSING). New tools based on Bayesian analysis will be handled and developed to analyse the data in an unprecedented way, separating different galaxy components (bulges and disks) in the datacubes using a novel spectrophotometric approach and shedding new light on the quenching processes driving galaxy evolution.
Data usage: All semesters
Status (06/09/17): Jairo is looking for students this autumn. If no students he will start working on the data himself.

Project AM21
PI:  Matteo Fossati, Alessandro Boselli
Title: “The star formation history of the perturbed Virgo cluster galaxy NGC 4424”
Abstract:  NGC 4424 is a peculiar star forming galaxy located in the Virgo cluster. Deep narrow band Halpha images indicate the presence of a nuclear starburst, with extraplanar low surface brightness tails of ionised gas. The lack of star forming regions in the outer disc and the presence of prominent Balmer absorption lines indicate that here the star formation activity has been abruptly quenched. We propose to combine 2D spectroscopic data from MUSE with multifrequency data covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum to study the star formation history of this peculiar galaxy. The spectro-photometric data will be compared to tuned models of galaxy evolution in rich environments and will be fitted with SED fitting codes to reconstruct the star formation history of NGC 4424 with the purpose to identify the physical mechanism responsible for the quenching of its star formation activity.

Title: “On the interaction between nuclear star formation and AGN in nearby galaxies.”
Abstract: The main goal would be to contribute to the understanding of the interaction between AGN and nuclear star formation in the context of galaxy evolution. Particularly, the goal would be to separate spectrally and spatially the contribution of the AGN from the contribution of stars, particularly young stars, in the central / nuclear regions of nearby AGN-host galaxies. A secondary goal would be to test the methods to derive the gas-phase metallicity in AGN-dominated regions (e.g. Dors et al.) and compare them to "standard" strong-line methods for HII regions. The methods to achieve these goals would be to map the dynamics of the ionized gas and stars of the central regions of these galaxies; also, to map the gas diagnostics with great detail in these regions, in order to disentangle between regions dominated by the influence of the AGN and regions where young stellar populations ionize the gas. The main technique to be applied is spectral fitting using Starlight, but we intend to also use other fitting techniques, mainly to test for type-1 AGN in the central-most regions of these galaxies. The expected results include maps of dynamics, ionized-gas diagnostics, stellar populations and gas metallicity of the central regions of these galaxies. Based on previous studies in the literature, we expect to find co-existence of both young-stellar populations within or close-by an AGN-influenced region, and we expect to better understand where this AGN-influenced region ends. We expect to submit two or three papers in the course of three years from this project. The maximum amount of money that we could get is 1.5M pesos to be spent in a total of three years, which is about 70k USD at current exchange rates. It's not much but it's enough to hire one postdoc, pay for the publications and a few international conferences, buy a couple of laptops, and maybe bring one of you guys to Mexico for a week or so. We have access to enough CPU power to run spectral fitting with starlight of about five previously-reduced MUSE datacubes per semester at median capacity. We found a list of observed galaxies from AMUSING in google and found six AGN-hosts in that list, so we conclude our project is feasible in the three-year period with our current capacity. We have also made sure that the technical specifications of MUSE make its data capable of and useful to execute our project. The group proposing this project includes a professor (to be confirmed), a reasearch-oriented postdoc (me), a teaching-oriented postdoc, an almost PhD graduate that is already working as a professor outside of Mexico, and a soon-to-be PhD student whose thesis project is partially related to this project. We plan to hire another post-doc if we get the mexican money, to be fully dedicated to this project. All members of this group have experience analyzing CALIFA and SAMI data with the same methods and technique proposed here, and some are currently experimenting with MaNGA data. We have also developed our own suite of spectral fitting and analysis routines based on Starlight, dubbed "The GIFU suite", so we consider we have enough experience to carry out this project successfully.

Title: “Simulating the host galaxies of quasars as seen by HARMONI”
Abstract: In the frame of the preparatory work for science with HARMONI, we are simulating different scientific cases to evaluate the performance of the instrument. For that, we make use of existing high-quality IFS data of nearby galaxies, that later on will be manipulated to mimic possible observations with HARMONI. MUSE data taken by the AMUSING project are ideal for this aim. Specifically, here we apply for the possibility of using the reduced cubes of the ellipticals (or early-type) galaxies to simulate the host galaxy of a quasar at different redshifts (up to z~2).
Data usage: NGC809 (may request additional cubes in the future)
Status (05/04/17): Just been sent data.
Status (13/09/17): Currently using data to simulate adding a quasar to MUSE cube and moving it to z=1.5...

Title: “AGN feedback in AMUSING galaxies”
Abstract:  The aim of this project is to study the presence of AGN in the AMUSING sample and investigate its relation with the star formation activity of the galaxies. The first step will be to classify the sample, based on optical emission-line ratios as well as on X-ray emission (from the literature and archival observations).  Then, we will compare the star formation histories inferred from stellar population synthesis models (Pipe3D) for galaxies with different mass, morphology, and nuclear activity, investigating both the galaxy as a whole as well as the central regions. Our preliminary results, based on the CALIFA sample, suggest that optically-selected AGN do not play a significant role on global scales, but it is possible that they do in the central regions.  Finally, we would like to explore a possible connection between AGN and winds/outflows on kpc scales. Here, the spatial and spectral resolution of MUSE are critical in order to achieve conclusive results.
Data usage: All galaxies with AGN

Title: “Spatial resolution effects in Nearby Galaxies: An AMUSING-MaNGA synergy.”
Abstract: The scaling relations observed in nearby galaxies such as the well-known Kennicutt-Schmidt Law that relates the star formation rate and the gas density appears to differs for at sub-kpc scales (e.g., Bigiel et al 2008). Thanks to the partial overlapping between the two IFU field of view of the AMUSING and the MaNGA surveys in the spiral galaxy NGC6962 we are able to probe the impact of the observed properties at different spatial scales.By comparing the two datasets, we are able to probe the spatially resolved relations such as the Sigma_*-Z or the SFMS relations, as well as radial gradients of the properties.
Data usage: SN2002ha (NGC6962 from P97)
