<!--Overall aims, strategy and policies, proposals-->

## The AMUSING survey strategy

Make use of non-optimal weather at Paranal to obtain a large amount of time on MUSE to observe SN host galaxies.

All observing constraints are set to (almost) lowest constraint. This means: ANY seeing; THN conditions; BRIGHT Moon; and we have objects across full RA and dec range meaning that pointing restrictions can be overcome. In practice, many objects will be observed in <1.2” seeing, plus dark/grey time, CLR conditions etc.

The project plan is to be as open as possible. 

## Proposal science aim for overall survey

Constrain SN progenitors through observations of their host environments w.r.t. their global host properties.
Refine the use of SN as probes of other processes in the Universe.
Constrain galaxy evolution, SF processes, dynamics, study extragalactic stellar populations.
