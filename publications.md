Title: “Oxygen abundance gradients + central decrement”
Abstract: “Along the last 30 years it has grown evidence of the presence of an oxygen abundance gradient in spiral galaxies that has been interpreted as an evidence of inside-out growth. More recently it has been proposed the presence of a common abundance gradient and central decrement correlated with the mass of galaxies, by the use of IFU surveys. However, its characterization is hampered by the coarse resolution of those surveys (CALIFA, PINGS, MaNGA...), thus we would like to explore it by the analysis of the HII regions within the AMUSING dataset.”

Title: “Emission line associated with a AGN driven jet in NGC232”
Abstract: “We describe the serendipity discovery of an optical jet driven by a central AGN in the galaxy NGC232, that extend across several kpc almost perpendicular to the galactic plany of the galaxy. The analysis of the gas kinematics and emission line ratios indicate that most probably the optical jet is ionized by a mixture of direct ionization by the AGN and shocks due to the lateral expansion of the jet across a dense medium. To our knowledge only two of these optical jets have been observed before (3C120 and 3C273), what place this object among one of the few laboratories to study this kind of processes.”

Title: “The lowest metallicity type II supernova from a high mass red-supergiant progenitor”
Abstract: “Red supergiant (RSG) stars have been confirmed as the progenitor stars of the majority of hydrogen-rich type II supernovae (SNe II). However, while RSGs are observed with masses >25 M⊙, detections of SN II progenitors with masses >18 M⊙ (To be defined) have remained elusive. RSGs are also expected to form and explode at all metallicities, but given the his-torical galaxy-targeted nature of past SN surveys, in addition to the low amount of total star-formation within low-luminosity galaxies (leading to a low SN rate), discoveries of explosions from such low-metallicity progenitors are also scarce. Here, we report observations of the SN II CSS140925:223344-062208, aka SN 2015bs, for which we infer a progenitor metallicity of Z0.1 Z⊙ and a Zero Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) mass of 17-18 M⊙. SN 2015bs displays a relatively normal light-curve morphology, together with the typical Balmer lines usually observed in photospheric-phase spectra of SNe II, implying a RSG progenitor. However, there is a clear lack of strong spectral lines originating from heavier elements such as iron. Comparison to spectral models confirm a progenitor metallicity of 0.1 Z⊙ or lower. This is consistent with observations of the host galaxy that constrain its absolute magnitude to be the lowest of any SN II host to-date, implying significantly sub-solar metallicity. At 2late phases SN 2015bs also shows unique features among SNe II. [OI] 6300,6364 °A is much stronger with respect to H  and [Ca II] 7291,7323 °A than for all other known SNe II. Nebular hydrogen emission is also broader implying higher velocities for the outer core material4. SN 2015bs is thus constrained to have a helium core mass produced by the explosion of an 17-18 M⊙ (To be defined) initial mass progenitor (Actually, putting a value here is necessary? Probably, but note Jesper’s ’strong logic’ point.). Why such a massive progenitor should also
be related to such a low progenitor metallicity is currently unknown.”
