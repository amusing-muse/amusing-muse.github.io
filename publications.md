### Project AM8
Title: Oxygen abundance gradients + central decrement  
PI: L. S치nchez-Menguiano  
Abstract: Along the last 30 years it has grown evidence of the presence of an oxygen abundance gradient in spiral galaxies that has been interpreted as an evidence of inside-out growth. More recently it has been proposed the presence of a common abundance gradient and central decrement correlated with the mass of galaxies, by the use of IFU surveys. However, its characterization is hampered by the coarse resolution of those surveys (CALIFA, PINGS, MaNGA...), thus we would like to explore it by the analysis of the HII regions within the AMUSING dataset.  
Data usage: All semesters  
Status: [Accepted](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01188)

### Project AM13
Title: Emission line associated with a AGN driven jet in NGC232  
PI: C. Cob치  
Abstract: We describe the serendipity discovery of an optical jet driven by a central AGN in the galaxy NGC232, that extend across several kpc almost perpendicular to the galactic plany of the galaxy. The analysis of the gas kinematics and emission line ratios indicate that most probably the optical jet is ionized by a mixture of direct ionization by the AGN and shocks due to the lateral expansion of the jet across a dense medium. To our knowledge only two of these optical jets have been observed before (3C120 and 3C273), what place this object among one of the few laboratories to study this kind of processes.
