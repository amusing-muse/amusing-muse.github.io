Here we list general notes and ideas on future uses of AMUSING data that have not yet been turned into official projects (ideas are removed when they have come to fruition).

### Overall ideas/future possibilities
- Missing Wolf-Rayet detection (pre/post explosion observations) FF: needs special pipeline (~1 year of work), does a MUSE subtraction pipeline exist?
- We have pre-explosion CUBE of SNII 2014cy (NGC7742). It will be interesting to get post-explosion cube in ~2 years to do CUBE subtraction (LG)
- transient search in spectral space: when have multiple epochs, e.g. if we get TOO obs in the future for SN follow-up, search for previously unknown transients in whatever combination of spectral features one wants
- New metallicity calibrator that is trained with HII region spaxels instead of the whole HII regions (LG) [I was thinking on a separate proposal for next semester, but maybe useful to check if any AMUSING galaxy has e.g. 4363 line, 0.1<z<0.2] JA: I am not sure that this makes sense. at >0.1z a MUSE spaxel will then contain stellar populations similar in physical size to CALIFA galaxies, no? [Enrique: I have checked that there are only a handful of galaxies within the z range, but none of them show the 4363 line. ]
- SN parent stellar population at the site (HK): compare all spaxels containing SNe, check age/metallicity differences etc Should this be submitted as an official project from Hanin?
- Hosts of SNe Ibn (HK): few Ibn are discovered each year and their host galaxies are not yet characterized. Do similar analysis like the other SN types. → other uncommon SN types may be also added to this (IcBL, SLSN when suitable)  JA: This is in a separate proposal submitted by Hanin?

## Future ideas of science focus for proposals
- well observed stripped envelope SNe hosts (inc. broad-line)
- complete the CSP SNIa sample
- 2nd ASAS-SN sample
- CHASE sample
- SNeII hosts for, esp. for EW--Z analysis
- well observed e.g. PESSTO events, i.e. ‘strange’ transients
- Interacting transients: IIn, impostors, Ibn etc
